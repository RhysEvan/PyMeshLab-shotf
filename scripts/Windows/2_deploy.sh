# This is a script shell for deploying a pymeshlab-portable folder.
# Requires a properly built PyMeshLab (see 1_build.sh).
#
# This script can be run only in the oldest supported linux distro
# due to linuxdeployqt tool choice (see https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/issues/340).
#
# Without given arguments, the folder that will be deployed is pymeshlab, which
# should be the path where PyMeshLab has been installed (default output of 1_build.sh).
#
# You can give as argument the path where you installed PyMeshLab.
